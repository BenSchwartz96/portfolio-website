//  Big problem. I don't *have* any testimonials. So, making this to follow along the tutorial but will probably not actually build out this section. 
//  
//  Maybe I could have this section be called "Goals" and have it further up the page, explaining what it is i want and value? or should that go in About?
//  maybe not - maybe about should be who i am, and my interests, more me as a person.
